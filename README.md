## Description of the content
- Cycling Routes: Contains .GPX files of routes I'm doing, day by day.
- Tent Spots: Contains .GPX points of spots where I camped. Mostly gardens of kind families they allowed me to sleep on their land.

You can open GPX files with any navigator supporting the format. I personally use LocusMap (https://www.locusmap.app on Android)
